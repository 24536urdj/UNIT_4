## Criteria A planning

### Problem definition
My client (who is currently a student in an ib school )has expressed  their worries about the accumulation of lessons and the amount of information they need to understand in order to pass their G11 exams in May, however since they live in a big school with more than 90 G11 and 40 G12 , Facebook group chat seem to not be adequate since it will anarchic and also very hard to find the notes you need for your own subjects and your own level , moreover it is also hard to just ask people  because they may be busy or their notes-style do not fit the learning style of the user or just you do not have the courage to ask them.
